My name is Aanjaneya Kumar and I am a PhD student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) working under the supervision of [Prof. M. S. Santhanam](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~santh/). My primary interest is in obtaining insight into practically relevant problems, which could arise in various fields including (but not restricted to) physics, biology, and the social sciences, by first formulating them as mathematical models and then analyzing them using tools from Statistical Physics, Graph Theory and Game Theory.

Summary 
=========
A very high-level goal of statistical physics is to provide a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional complex systems. This is not always an easy task. Ideally, one wants to arrive at a description which captures essential features of the complex system at hand, but one which is also simple enough, so that it is tractable, and further insight into the system can be generated from it. This is where stochastic processes play an important role, which is a unifying theme of my research interests. The general philosophy behind stochastic modelling is that when you are faced with unmanageable complexity, a good first step is to model that with randomness. The pursuit of describing elements of a complex system in the simplest manner possible, and the remarkable success of stochastic modelling in doing so has shaped my research interests significantly. 

The general philosophy described above, in fact, goes much beyond statistical physics and can be thought of as a guiding principle for fruitful research across disciplines. I try my best to keep this approach in mind while tackling research problems. Some of my research endeavours end up in the form of publications and a list of them can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SSj4BocAAAAJ&hl=en). A lot of things that I gain from my research do not end up being part of the final research paper that I write but I would be very happy to talk to you about them. I strongly believe in science being a collective and collaborative effort and I look forward to discussing ideas with you.

<!-- 
Extreme events, broadly defined as those events whose numerical values show a pronounced deviation from their typical values and exceed some predefined threshold, are ubiquitous and they occur in a wide variety of natural, social and engineering systems. Not surprisingly, the study of extreme events and systemic failures has received a lot of recent research attention. Starting from market crashes and power blackouts, to extreme climate events and internet breakdown -- extreme events can lead to disastrous consequences in the systems they occur in and severely disrupt their functioning. To this end, a growing body of literature is focused towards building a theoretical framework to analyze such rare events. The classical extreme value statistics is nearly a century old and more recently, advances in large deviation theory have improved our understanding of extreme events. There also has been an interesting line of work, which has aimed to understand how extreme events take place in networked systems. -->

<!-- In my [first project](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5139018) as a PhD student, I explored the problem of extreme events taking place on the *edges* of a network, and showed that they show strikingly different statistics than extreme events taking place on the *nodes* of a network. I computed exactly the statistics of the load and flux on each edge of the network and established that the probability of extreme events occurring on them is given by the regularized incomplete Beta function. Furthermore, I studied time delayed correlations between extreme events occurring on nodes and edges and found that while low degree nodes are more prone to extreme events, carefully observing their neighbouring nodes can lead to identification of precursors. Our results provide a mathematical framework to study network failure through edge deletion mechanism induced by extreme events and provides a systematic route to model the edge deletion rates, based on the underlying dynamical process taking place on the network. Our work was published in the special issue of *Chaos* titled *Rare Events in Complex Systems: Understanding and Prediction*.



Following up on the theme of extreme events, last year we initiated a study of [threshold crossing events in the presence of incomplete observations](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.L052103). The problem was motivated by practical applications, where there is an energy cost associated with keeping the "sensor" (which monitors the process of interest) on, and the threshold crossing events in the process of interest are thus monitored by intermittent sensors that are not active at all times. A principal example is of wireless sensor networks, which are widely deployed to monitor rare events at remote locations and operate under tight energy constraints. These sensors are typically not always active in order to optimise power consumption. Other examples where such a scenario arises is where there is simply a lack of data, and the process of interest has only been observed in certain time intervals. Mathematically, our problem can be stated as follows -- consider a time-series $X(t)$, which could be an observable of interest e.g. price of a commodity, temperature of a city, or the damage accumulated in a system. The time taken for $X(t)$ to cross a pre-defined threshold is a practically relevant observable called the "first passage time", and it continues to attract active research attention. However, what happens when we cannot always observe $X(t)$, and can only observe it intermittently? In that case, the relevant quantity of interest is the "first detection time", which denotes the first time when the process $X(t)$ is *detected* or *observed* to be above the threshold. For a schematic, see the figure below:

Some preliminary results obtained in the project were presented in the previous PMRF review (held in December 2020). In this project, we studied the general problem of threshold crossing under intermittent sensing using the versatile birth-death process, and a sensor that stochastically switches between active and inactive states, modelled as a two-state Markov process. We obtained a general relation between the first detection time distribution, under intermittent sensing, and the first passage time distribution. One of our central results dictates that the first detection time can be obtained from the first passage times, which is exactly known for a wide range of problems. We demonstrated the validity of our results in a variety of applications including the SIS model of epidemics, logistic model, and also extended our formalism to include birth-death processes which undergo burst like relaxtions and reset to the origin. Intermittent sensing of the process $X(t)$ leads to interesting new features -- when the threshold crossing is first detected, the value of $X(t)$ need not be exactly equal to the threshold, but can be anywhere in the state space above it. The information about in which state the threshold crossing event is detected is contained in the splitting probabilities, which our formalism allows us to compute exactly. Finally, we considered the problem of inferring first passage times from the knowledge of first detection. We asked -- if the first detection of a threshold crossing event happens at time $T_d$, can we estimate what will be the first passage  time $T_f$? The answer to this question has practical value as it estimates the first occurrence time for an event that possibly went undetected. In sensors that detect abnormal voltage fluctuations (such large voltage fluctuations can damage the device), $T_f$ corresponds to the time until which the device being monitored was fully functional (not damaged), but this fluctuation could go unnoticed, and $T_d$ denotes the time when sensor detects the large fluctuation for the first time.  For this problem, we were able to compute the exact first passage distribution, conditioned on the first detection time, and solved the inference problem. 

The work described above was written up in June 2021, and has now been published in Physical Review E as a [Letter](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.L052103). However, we have continued to explore many interesting questions that have arised out of this project, under the broad theme of partially observable stochastic processes. By mapping the mathematical analysis in our project to the mathematics underlying the theory of gated reactions (which are very important and well-studied topics in Chemistry and Biology), we have been able to extend our work in such a way that now $X(t)$ is no longer restricted to being a discrete-space Markov process. In particular, we can compute the first detection time distribution for $X(t)$ generated by non-Markovian process with discrete states that satisfy the renewal property. New challenges emerge when one wishes to compute the first detection time statistics where $X(t)$ is a  continuous process (and does not have a discrete state space). This continuous case problem also has an interesting theoretical feature -- the theory developed for gated reactions in continuous space do not extend to the problem of first detection of threshold crossing events when $X(t)$ is a continuous process. This has encouraged us to come up with a new formalism, that allows for the analysis for cases where $X(t)$ is a continuous time-series that follows Markovian evolution. The details of this new formalism will be presented in the upcoming PMRF review. Furthermore, the problem of intermittent sensing also leads to interesting optimization problems -- what should the rates $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (see schematic above) be, so that the time between first passage and first detection is decreased, and also, the time spent by the sensor in its active state is decreased? Some preliminary results on our efforts of solving this optimization problem will be discussed in the upcoming review.
